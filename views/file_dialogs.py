"""Where a file dialog opens, and what it remembers between drawings.

Every dialog used to be handed ``""`` as its starting directory, and Qt
resolves that against the process's working directory. That was harmless
from a terminal and fatal in the Flatpak: the launcher works in
``/app/ingecad``, but the file chooser runs *outside* the sandbox through
the desktop portal, where no such path exists — so choosing File ▸ Open put
up "No se pudo encontrar «/app/ingecad»" instead of a file chooser.

So the rule is: a dialog is never given an empty or relative location. It is
given a directory that exists on the user's own filesystem, chosen the way
AutoCAD chooses it — the folder you were last in, then the folder of the
drawing you have open, then Documents, then home.
