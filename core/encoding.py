r"""The DXF handed to the DWG converter, and the escapes read back from one.

``dxf2dwg`` writes an r2000 DWG, and what it does with the DXF it is given
depends on that file's own version. Measured on real drawings, with the
converters IngeCAD ships:

* A drawing whose DXF version is **pre-R13** loses everything: the DWG comes
  back with zero entities (LibreDWG's pre-R13 writer gap, issue #1386). Four
  R12 files in the test bench did exactly that.
* Handing it an **R2000** DXF instead converts those same four completely.

So the intermediate always goes out as R2000. That is the version the DWG
will have anyway, which is what makes the downgrade free: nothing an r2000
DWG could carry is lost by it.

Accents used to need a second half here — MTEXT pre-escaped to ``\U+xxxx``,
because LibreDWG mangled non-ASCII text on the way in. That was
LibreDWG issue #1393, fixed by PR #1375 and shipped in ``vendor/`` since the
0.14.8580 re-vendorization, so the escaping is gone: the file now carries the
text the user actually typed.

Reading the escapes back stays. AutoCAD itself writes ``\U+xxxx`` for a
character its codepage cannot hold, and ezdxf does not decode it, so without
this the canvas shows the raw code instead of the character.
