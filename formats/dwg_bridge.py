"""DWG <-> DXF bridge through a satellite process: LibreDWG.

DWG is never parsed inside the app (architectural principle #2): the
LibreDWG command-line tools run as external converters, the same satellite
pattern IngeTrazo uses for skp2dae. The user double-clicks a ``.dwg`` and
never sees the intermediate DXF.

Search order for the tools: the bundle shipped with IngeCAD
(``vendor/libredwg/bin``), then the system PATH. IngeCAD ships a patched
LibreDWG that reads DWG up to r2018 and writes r2000; r2013/r2018 write
support arrives with LibreDWG Track L progress (no proprietary satellite).
