    CI failed with "821 passed ... Aborted (core dumped)": every test green,
    then glibc's "double free or corruption" while interpreter shutdown
    destroyed the MainWindows the tests leave open. The crash needs pytest to
    happen: the byte-for-byte same operations and teardown in a bare script
    exit cleanly, and so does the real application -- opened a real plan,
    edited a block, closed, full teardown, exit 0 on offscreen and xcb alike.
    So this is a pytest-environment artifact, not a defect a user can reach.

    (Since 2026-10-09 closed windows are really deleted -- WA_DeleteOnClose
    and _let_closed_windows_go above -- so few are left at exit; the exit
    stays skipped, it costs nothing.)

    Two better-looking fixes were tried and measured worse. Reaping windows
    per test made the double free DETERMINISTIC (and broke the tidy tests'
    stale wrappers); joining threads per test let the leaked windows' regen
    timers fire full rebuilds on every processEvents -- the 7-minute suite
    stopped finishing inside 18. Skipping a teardown nobody needs is smaller
    than both. It lives in unconfigure, not sessionfinish: the terminal
    reporter prints its "N passed" line in a sessionfinish hookWRAPPER whose
    tail runs after every plain impl, so exiting there ate the summary.
