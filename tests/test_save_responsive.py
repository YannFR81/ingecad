"""Ctrl+S on a big plan does not freeze the window.

The release bench (tools/release_bench.py, 2026-09-27) caught it: Save as
DWG on Plaza Yanque froze the window for ~10 s, already in v0.6.4. 7.7 s of
that is LibreDWG's conversion and the check that reads it back -- file
work that never touches the drawing -- so it runs on a worker while the
window keeps painting. Keyboard and mouse are held meanwhile, as AutoCAD
holds them while it saves, so nothing edits, opens or closes the drawing
halfway through.

The file half is slowed down here so there is time to watch.
