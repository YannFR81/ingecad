"""Regenerate the model on several cores (#31).

A full regen is ezdxf's drawing frontend -- pure Python, one entity after
another -- and nearly all of it: on Plaza Yanque (10 000 objects) 4.26 s of
the frontend against 0.11 s of packing. Python threads share one GIL, so the
cores sat idle while the window waited.

Each worker is a fork of this process: it inherits the drawing as it is in
memory (nothing to serialise, nothing to re-read), draws ITS share of the
entities through the very same ``draw_layout`` -- a filter lets through only
its handles, so the redraw order, the background, the annotation scale and
every other rule are the ones a serial regen applies -- and sends back its
buckets. The parent stitches them in order and packs as before.

The shares are runs of consecutive entities in redraw order, cut by an
estimate of what each costs -- an INSERT costs what its block holds, nested
blocks included -- four per worker, each handed to whichever worker is
free. What cannot be split (one block of 15 000 objects) bounds the
speed-up.

Linux only (fork); anywhere else, for a small drawing, or if anything goes
wrong -- a worker that fails or takes too long -- the caller draws serially,
as it always did. ``INGECAD_SERIAL_REGEN=1`` forces the serial path.
